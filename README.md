# MSCS532_Assignment4
This repo is assignment 4 for MSCS532 (Algorithm and Data Struture) course
# Part 1
Part 1 has implementd in two part. First, **heap_sort.py** is a simple heap-sorting algorithm implementation where it sorted an given array. Then the next part is the implementation of the time comparison. To perform it simply run **compare_heap.py** which will compare the time between heap sort , quick sort and merge sort.
# Part 2
Part 2 is for Priority Queue Implementation and Applications. The implementation of this part is in **queue.py** file. Here I have implemented the priority queue using the binary heap sort algorithm. Where,
- insert(task) : It will add a task to the heap and maintan the max-heap property.
- extract_max() : This fuctiin will removes and returns the task with the highest priority.
- increase_key(task, new_priority): Increases the priority of a task and adjusts its position in the heap.
- is_empty(): Checks if the priority queue is empty.
After performing **queue.py** it extact the data and remove it form the list as per the code implpementation also it can increse the priority of the list as per the code.
